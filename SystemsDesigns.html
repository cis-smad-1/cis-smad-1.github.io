			tasks with no/ minimal guidance. The questions and tasks we will ask of the interviewees will be as follows:</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Locate the Trump Tower Moscow Project pages from the Mueller Report.</li>
			<li>Find the amount of times the word “investigation” appears in the House Impeachment Report- Exec Summary Section 1.</li>

		</ul>
		<li>The people being interviewed will be asked to think out loud and vocalize all frustrations they face throughout their experience using story 
			analyzer. This will ensure that we will be able to understand where exactly the frustrations lie and what the needs of the user are.</li>
